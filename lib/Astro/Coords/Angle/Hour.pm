=head1 NAME

Astro::Coords::Angle::Hour - Representation of an angle in units of hours

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Astro::Coords::Angle::Hour;

  $ha = new Astro::Coords::Angle::Hour( "12h30m22.4s", units => 'sex');
  $ha = new Astro::Coords::Angle::Hour( 12.53, units => 'hour);

  $ha = new Astro::Coords::Angle::Hour( 12.53 );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Class similar to C<Astro::Coords::Angle> but representing the angle
as a time. Suitable for use as hour angle or Right Ascension.
Inherits from C<Astro::Coords::Angle>.

For hour angle a range of "PI" is suitable, for Right Ascension use "2PI".
Default range is none at all. If no units are provided, the units will be
guessed using the same scheme as for C<Astro::Coords::Angle> except that
values greater than 2PI will be assumed to be decimal hours.

=over 4

=item B<hours>

Return the angle in decimal hours.

 $deg = $ang->hours;

sub hours {
  my $self = shift;
  my $rad = $self->radians;
  return $rad * Astro::PAL::DR2H;
}

=head2 General Methods

=over 4

=item B<in_format>

As for base class implementation, except that 'hour' (and abbreviation) is a supported
format. 'sexagesimal' format will result in a stringified form of the object in hours,
minutes and seconds.

 $hr = $hour->in_format( 'hour' );

=cut

sub in_format {
  my $self = shift;
  my $format = shift;
  $format = lc($format) if $format;
  return $self->hours() if (defined $format && $format =~ /^h/);
  return $self->SUPER::in_format( $format );
}

=head2 Class Methods

The following methods control the default behaviour of the class.

=over 4

=item B<NDP>

As for the base class except that the default number of decimal places
is 3.

This method has no effect on the base class.

=cut

{
  my $DEFAULT_NDP = 3;
  my $NDP = $DEFAULT_NDP;
  sub NDP {
    my $class = shift;
    if (@_) {
      my $arg = shift;
      if (defined $arg) {
	$NDP = $arg;
      } else {
	$NDP = $DEFAULT_NDP;
      }
    }
    return $NDP;
  }
}

=item B<DELIM>

As for the base class. The global value in this class does not have
any effect on the base class.

=cut

{
  my $DEFAULT_DELIM = ":";
  my $DELIM = $DEFAULT_DELIM;
  sub DELIM {
    my $class = shift;
    if (@_) {
      my $arg = shift;
      if (defined $arg) {
	$DELIM = $arg;
      } else {
	$DELIM = $DEFAULT_DELIM;
      }
    }
    return $DELIM;
  }
}

=head2 Private Methods

These methods are not part of the API and should not be called directly.
They are documented for completeness.

=over 4

=item B<_cvt_torad>

Same as the base class, except that if the units are hours
or sexagesimal, the resulting number is multiplied by 15 before being
passed up to the constructor (since 24 hours is equivalent to 360 degrees).

=cut

sub _cvt_torad {
  my $self = shift;
  my $input = shift;
  my $units = shift;

  # If we haven't got any units attempt to guess some
  $units = $self->_guess_units( $input ) unless defined $units;

  # if units are hours, tell the base class we have degrees
  # $unt is the unit that will be reported to the base class
  # $units is the unit known to the subclass
  my $unt = $units;
  if (defined $units && $units =~ /^h/) {
    $unt = 'deg';
  }

  # Do the conversion
  my $rad = $self->SUPER::_cvt_torad( $input, $unt );

  # scale if we had sexagesimal or hour as units
  if (defined $rad && $units =~ /^[sh]/) {
    $rad *= 15;
  }

  return $rad;
}

=item B<_guess_units>

Guess the units. Same as base class except that values greater than 2PI
radians are assumed to be hours rather than degrees.

 $guess = $hr->_guess_units( $input );

=cut

sub _guess_units {
  my $self = shift;
  my $input = shift;
  my $guess = $self->SUPER::_guess_units( $input );
  $guess = 'h' if $guess =~ /^d/;
  return $guess;
}

=item B<_r2f>

Routine to convert angle in radians to a formatted array
of numbers in order of sign, hour, min, sec, frac.

  @retval = $ang->_r2f( $ndp );

Note that the number of decimal places is an argument.

=back

=cut

sub _r2f {
  my $self = shift;
  my $res = shift;
  my ($sign, @dmsf) = Astro::PAL::palDr2tf($res, $self->radians);
  return ($sign, @dmsf);
}
