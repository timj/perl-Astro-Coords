Astro::Coords
=============

This module provides an object oriented approach to astronomical
coordinate transformations. It can be used to convert between
J2000, B1950, Galactic and super Galactic coordinates.  It can
calculate the azimuth and elevation of a source specified in
equatorial coordinates, orbital elements or by name (if a planet).
It can also determine whether the specified coordinates are observable
for the given telescope and determine rise and set times. Doppler
corrections can also be calculated.

This software is still a beta release but is in use in a production
environment. The interfaces may still change slightly.

It is a wrapper class around Astro::PAL that simplifies the handling of
astronomical coordinate systems.

Requirements
------------

This class uses Astro::PAL, Astro::Telescope as well as
DateTime and Time::Piece.

This release begins the migration from Time::Piece to DateTime
for specification of epochs. Both are supported at present but
at some point Time::Piece support may be removed.

Building
--------

  perl Build.PL
  ./Build
  ./Build test
  ./Build install
